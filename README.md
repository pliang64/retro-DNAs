# retro-DNAs
Customized perl and shell scripts for identifications of retro-DNAs in the primate genomes
Specifically for processes including
1) generating LiftOver chain files between a pair of primate genomes
2) Integrating neighourng fragments of a transposable element (TE) annotated by RepeatMasker
3) finding TSDs and insertion-mediated deletion associated with TEs
4) clustering TEs across species into orthologous groups
